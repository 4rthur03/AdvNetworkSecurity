\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} medical industry has change ever since the first computer were introduced. The healthcare technologies have the potential to extend, save and enhance the live of patients. Furthermore, hospitals have witnessed a proliferation of networked medical equipment in the past decade. There is an emergent trend of connection medical equipment to the hospital network for easy accessibility and manageability. As healthcare devices continue to evolve, so does the inter-connectivity. For example, it provides efficiency, error reduction, automation, and remote monitoring. Interconnected technology allows health professionals to monitor and adjust devices without the need for hospital visit or invasive procedure \cite{coventry2018cybersecurity}. With integration comes complexity and cahllenges in management and this protection \cite{williams2015cybersecurity}. However, interconnected technology introduces new cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the same way other networked computing systems are vulnerable. Recently, securing medical devices against cyberattacks or malware outbreaks and safeguarding protected health information (PHI) stored on devices or exchanged between a device and the provider's network is a growing challenge for clinical engineers and hospital information technology (IT) professional \cite{wirth2011cybercrimes}. The number of high-profile public demonstrations of successful attacks on devices and medical networks have increased. This fact raises the concern that inter-connectivity will directly affect clinical care and patient safety. \par
